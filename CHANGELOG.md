# Changelog

All notable changes to **SkillForge MCP** are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-24

Full CLI parity for security knobs, manual blacklist patterns, and version-policy pins — all previously requiring hand-edits to `config.json` or the `skills__configure` MCP tool.

### Added

- **`skillforge security` CLI group** — terminal management of the audit and blacklist settings across four sub-areas:
  - `security audit-exceptions list|add|remove|clear` — manage `config.security.auditExceptions` (skills whose example code legitimately contains flagged patterns).
  - `security audit-target [scripts|all]` — get or set `config.security.auditTarget` (`scripts` default scans only fenced code blocks; `all` scans the whole body).
  - `security audit-patterns list` — read-only view of the code-seeded audit patterns (regex + label).
  - `security blacklist list|add|remove|clear` — manage `config.blacklist`; `list` shows each entry's classified KIND (`exact` / `name-glob` / `path-glob`).
  All sub-commands accept `--json` on `list`, idempotent `add`, `clear --yes`, and the global `--verbose` / `--quiet` flags. After any mutation a reindex hint is printed.
- **`skillforge version-policy` CLI group** — terminal management of per-bundle version pinning:
  - `version-policy list [--json]` — show the current policy map with resolved kinds.
  - `version-policy set <bundle> <latest|major.minor.patch>` — pin a bundle to an exact version or restore highest-semver resolution with `latest`.
  - `version-policy remove <bundle>` — remove a single pin (reverts to `latest`).
  - `version-policy clear --yes` — wipe the entire policy map.
- **Blacklist pattern types** — `config.blacklist` entries are now auto-classified by syntax: a plain name is an exact match (unchanged); an entry with `*` or `?` but no `/` is a glob over the skill name (e.g. `wiki-*`); any entry containing `/` is a glob over the skill source path relative to its registered root folder (e.g. `**/agenthub/**`). Implemented with a self-contained glob compiler — no new dependency. The exclude log and the filter verdict carry the matched pattern and its kind.

### Changed

- Blacklist exact-name matching is unchanged — all existing entries in `config.blacklist` continue to work with no migration needed.

### Verified

- 867 tests passing + 2 skipped; `tsc --noEmit` clean; all source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-23

Security-teaching skills load again, and the freshest installed version of a bundle wins.

### Added

- **`security.auditTarget`** (`scripts` default, or `all`). The auto-audit now scans only fenced executable code blocks (`python`, `sh`, `js`, …) by default rather than the whole document. A skill whose prose merely *mentions* a flagged pattern — a security guide documenting `exec(` or `shell=True` in a table — no longer excludes itself. With `allowScripts:false` such a mention is never executed, so scanning it was a false positive. Set `all` to restore whole-body scanning.
- **`security.auditExceptions`** — a case-sensitive skill-name allowlist that bypasses the auto-audit for skills whose example code legitimately contains flagged patterns (security auditors, lint rule packs). The manual blacklist still applies.
- **`versionPolicy`** — a per-bundle map (`<bundle>` → `latest` | `<major.minor.patch>`). Pin a bundle to an exact version, or pin it to its current version to freeze it against newer installs. Defaults to `latest`.

### Fixed

- **Highest installed version wins on a name collision.** When one recursive root holds two installed versions of a bundle (`…/<bundle>/2.3.0/…` and `…/2.4.4/…`), the resolver now keeps the highest semver instead of whichever the filesystem enumerated first. Cross-folder priority still takes precedence; an unparseable version falls back to stable input order.

### Verified

- 811 tests passing + 2 skipped.

## [1.7.1] — 2026-05-19

Quieter default diagnostics — operator terminals stay clean, and only files SkillForge can actually load show up as skip lines.

### Added

- **Leveled stderr logger.** Diagnostics are now filtered by threshold (`debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error`). Default is `info`; folder-scan failures, blacklist exclusions, and name collisions still surface, but routine per-file skip lines are suppressed. `--verbose` / `-v` flips the threshold to `debug`; `--quiet` / `-q` raises it to `warn`. The `SKILLFORGE_DEBUG=1` or `DEBUG=1` env vars also force `debug`. The `logging.level` config key drives the default when no flag/env override is set.
- **`skills reload` error breakdown.** The summary now splits the error sink into `folder-failures` vs `file-skips`, so an operator sees the failure distribution at a glance instead of one opaque count.

### Changed

- **Candidate-file rule wired through the format registry.** A `.md` inside a configured folder is treated as a skill candidate only when at least one enabled format descriptor matches its filename (or non-empty frontmatter field). A non-candidate file is silently ignored at every log level — `README.md`, `references/*.md`, and `assets/*.md` siblings inside a skill directory no longer produce per-file skip lines. A candidate file with broken frontmatter still logs a debug skip so real defects are reachable with `--verbose`.

### Verified

- 781 tests passing + 2 skipped.
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean, `pnpm build` clean, `pnpm smoke` passes.
- All source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-19

A config-driven skill format registry — add support for new LLM layouts without a code release.

### Added

- **Skill format registry.** "What counts as a skill file" is no longer hardcoded. SkillForge reads a declarative list of format descriptors (`config.skillFormats`) — four built-ins (`claude`, `codex`, `persona`, `custom`) merged with operator entries. Each descriptor carries an `id`, a `match` rule (exact filename, filename glob, or non-empty frontmatter field), a `nameField`, a `deriveNameFromDir` flag, plus `enabled` and `priority`. Adding support for, say, Gemini Gem files (`GEMINI.md`) is now a one-line config edit.
- **Directory-name derivation.** A canonical file (`SKILL.md` / `AGENTS.md`) without a `name:` in its frontmatter is no longer unaddressable — the skill registers under a kebab-normalized parent-directory name (`migration-architect/SKILL.md` → `migration-architect`). Derivation is a per-format opt-in (`deriveNameFromDir: true`) limited to filename and filename-glob matches, so a sibling `README.md` is never mistaken for a skill.
- **`skillforge formats` subcommand.** Manage the registry from the shell: `formats list`, `formats add <id> --filename|--filename-glob|--frontmatter-field …`, `formats remove`, `formats enable`, `formats disable`. Built-ins can be disabled or replaced by reusing their id, but not removed.
- **Provenance in JSON output.** `skills get` and `skills list` carry two new optional fields per skill: `formatId` (which descriptor matched) and `nameSource` (`"frontmatter"` or `"directory"`). The `skills get` text view shows them too. A derived name also emits an info log to stderr.
- **Name-collision diagnostics.** When a skill name registers from more than one folder, SkillForge logs the kept winner and the ignored copies on stderr; the resolver still picks the highest-priority folder, no crash.

### Changed

- The persistent on-disk registry index gained two optional fields (`formatId`, `nameSource`). `INDEX_VERSION` bumps to `2`; any older index loads as `null` and triggers a normal rebuild — never a crash.

### Verified

- 749 tests passing + 2 skipped.
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean, `pnpm build` clean, `pnpm smoke` passes.
- All source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-19

A persistent on-disk registry index — fast warm starts for the CLI.

### Added

- **Persistent registry index.** SkillForge now writes a registry snapshot to `<configDir>/cache/registry-index.json`. Because each `skillforge skills get` runs as a fresh process, the in-memory caches always started empty and forced a full cold scan (recursive directory walk + frontmatter parse of every skill file). A subsequent process now hydrates the registry from the index with a single file read and parses only the one skill it was asked for. A benchmark over 500 synthetic skills shows a warm `skills get` at ~28 ms versus ~109 ms cold — roughly a 3.8x speedup.
- **Fingerprint-based invalidation.** The index stores a stable hash of every skill file's path and modification time. Each call recomputes it from filesystem metadata only — no frontmatter parse — and rebuilds when a skill file is added, removed, or edited in place. A corrupt, missing, or version-mismatched index degrades silently to a full rebuild.
- **Batch `skills get a,b,c`.** `skillforge skills get` accepts a comma-separated list of names and fetches them all in one process. With `--json`, a single name keeps the original object form for backward compatibility; multiple names emit `{ skills, errors }` so partial failures stay visible.
- **`skillforge skills reindex`.** Forces a rebuild of the on-disk index regardless of its fingerprint (creating it if absent) and prints a summary — skill count, index path, and build time. Distinct from `reload`, which only rebuilds the in-memory registry of the current process.
- **`--no-cache` flag** for the `skills` commands — bypasses the on-disk index and forces a full cold scan, for debugging and CI.
- **`cache.indexEnabled` / `cache.indexPath`** config keys to toggle the index and override its location.

### Verified

- 684 tests passing + 2 skipped.
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean, `pnpm build` clean, `pnpm smoke` passes.
- All source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-18

A fourth host installer target: Hermes Agent.

### Added

- **`skillforge install --hermes`** — wires SkillForge into the Hermes Agent config. The installer edits the Hermes YAML config (`~/.hermes/config.yaml`, or `$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml`; `--scope project` targets `./.hermes/config.yaml`) and adds a `mcp_servers.skillforge` entry. The config is round-tripped through a comment-preserving YAML parser, so the sibling `mcp:` provider key, other servers, and operator comments survive the edit. The entry carries the Hermes-specific `enabled` / `timeout` / `connect_timeout` fields alongside `command` / `args`. `install --all` now auto-detects and installs into Hermes too; `--hermes --uninstall` and `--hermes --dry-run` work as for the other hosts.
- A post-install reminder for Hermes — the host caches its MCP tool list, so a fresh install needs `/reload-mcp`, a new session, or `hermes gateway restart` before SkillForge appears.

### Verified

- 649 tests passing + 2 skipped.
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean, `pnpm build` clean, `pnpm smoke` passes.
- All source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-05-18

A single canonical entry point and a registry-independent install default.

### Added

- **`--entry auto` — the new default for `skillforge install`** (`src/installers/entry.ts`). The previous default, `--entry npx`, wrote `command=npx args=['-y','@lyupro/skillforge-mcp','serve']`, which re-resolves the package from the npm registry on every server spawn. On a machine with a registry cooldown policy (`min-release-age` in `.npmrc`) or no network, that resolution fails and the server does not start. `--entry auto` inspects the installer's own on-disk location: a stable install writes `command=node args=[<absolute dist/cli/dispatcher.js>,'serve']` — no registry, no network, offline-safe; a one-shot `npx … install` run (no stable file to point at) falls back to an npx entry. `--entry npx` and `--entry local` remain available as explicit overrides.

### Changed

- **One canonical entry point.** `dist/cli/dispatcher.js` is the single entry point — run it with `serve` (its default subcommand) to start the MCP stdio server. `src/server.ts` is now a pure module (`buildServer` / `buildDeps` / `startServer`) and is no longer directly runnable. The server-start sequence, previously duplicated between `server.ts` and the dispatcher, now lives in one exported `startServer()`.
- **Installer entries target the canonical dispatcher.** `skillforge install` (`--entry auto` and `--entry local`) now points host configs at `dist/cli/dispatcher.js` with an explicit `serve` argument, instead of the internal `dist/server.js` module. The default `--binary-path` is `dist/cli/dispatcher.js`.
- The three host installers (Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor) share a single entry-resolution module (`src/installers/entry.ts`) instead of each carrying its own copy of the entry-building logic.

### Verified

- 627 tests passing + 2 skipped (sandbox + a win32-only symlink skip).
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean, `pnpm build` clean, `pnpm smoke` passes against `dist/cli/dispatcher.js serve`.
- All source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-18

A fix for the CLI silently doing nothing under a global install.

### Fixed

- **CLI was a silent no-op when installed globally** (`src/cli/dispatcher.ts`) — `npm install -g` installs the bin as a symlink (`/usr/bin/skillforge-mcp` → `dist/cli/dispatcher.js`). The dispatcher gated its entry point on `process.argv[1] === fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`; under a symlinked bin `process.argv[1]` is the symlink path while `import.meta.url` resolves to the real file, so the strings never matched. Every command — `install`, `serve`, `tools`, `folders`, `skills`, `--version`, `--help` — parsed, did nothing, and exited 0 with no output. Affected every global install on Linux/macOS; Windows escaped it because the npm `.cmd` shim passes the resolved file path as `argv[1]`. Entry detection now resolves both sides through `realpath` (new exported `isMainModule` helper), so symlinked and direct invocations both work.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-17

Config live-reload, a new `skills` CLI subcommand, more accurate conflict detection, and forward-compatible config schemas.

### Added

- **`ConfigWatcher`** (`src/watcher/config-watcher.ts`) — watches the config directory and reconciles the folder list and skill registry whenever `config.json` changes on disk. Previously a long-lived MCP server held a startup snapshot and never saw edits made by the `skillforge folders` CLI (which writes from a separate process) until the server was restarted. `skills__configure` `list_folders` and `get_blacklist` now report current disk state instead of the in-memory snapshot.
- **`skillforge skills` CLI subcommand** (`src/cli/skills.ts`) — terminal-side skill inspection without an LLM session. Three commands:
  - `skills list` — prints a table of all registered skills. Filters: `--search <text>`, `--source <name>`, `--folder <path|alias>`, `--folder-tag <name>`. Display options: `--json`, `--folder-fmt alias|path` (the `FOLDER` column shows the alias by default when one is set).
  - `skills get <name>` — prints the full SKILL.md body and frontmatter for a single skill.
  - `skills reload` — forces a full registry rescan and prints folder/skill counts.

### Changed

- **Conflict-hint accuracy** (`src/detect/skill-source-conflict.ts`) — the skill-source conflict detector (warns when a registered folder overlaps with a host plugin's native store, which would double-load skills) previously ran on path logic alone and warned even for plugins the user had already disabled. It now reads the host's plugin enable state: a disabled plugin produces no warning; an unknown/unreadable enable state produces a softened conditional hint.
- **Config schema forward-compatibility** (`src/config/config-schema.ts`) — all Zod config schemas previously used the default `strip` mode, silently dropping unknown keys on load/save. Any config written by a newer version of SkillForge would lose unrecognised fields when read by an older version. All schemas now use `passthrough`, so unknown keys survive a full load/save round-trip.

### Verified

- 609 / 609 tests passing + 1 win32-skip (610 total).
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean.
- `pnpm build` clean.
- `pnpm check:size` — all 68 source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-16

Folder ergonomics — address folders by a short alias, toggle them on and off, and filter skills by folder tag.

### Added

- Folder alias. A folder entry now carries an optional kebab-case `alias` — a single short handle for a folder. `skillforge folders add <path> --alias <name>` registers it; `skillforge folders remove <name>` and the new `skillforge folders alias <path|alias> <name>` accept the alias in place of the full absolute path. The full path keeps working everywhere. Aliases are validated kebab-case and unique across registered folders — a collision fails with exit ≠ 0 and leaves the config untouched. The `skills__configure` `add_folder` action accepts an `alias` field too, and `folders list` shows an `ALIAS` column.
- `skillforge folders enable <path|alias>` / `skillforge folders disable <path|alias>` — a two-way toggle for the `enabled` flag. `folders add --disabled` previously had no inverse; re-activating a folder meant hand-editing `config.json`. A disabled folder stays in the config but is skipped on scan.
- Folder-tag filtering. Folder `tags` were written to the config but never read. `skills__list` now accepts a `folderTag` argument that keeps only skills under folders carrying that tag, and `skillforge folders list --tag <name>` filters the listing the same way. `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` gains a "tags vs alias" section: `alias` is one unique handle per folder for addressing, `tags` are many shared labels for grouping.

### Changed

- `src/cli/folders.ts` split into four flat sibling modules (`folders.ts`, `folders-handlers.ts`, `folders-format.ts`, `folders-shared.ts`) to stay under the 400-line file gate. The `dispatcher.ts` import path is unchanged.

### Verified

- 561 / 561 tests passing + 1 win32-skip.
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean.
- `pnpm build` clean.
- `pnpm check:size` — all source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-16

Terminal-side tooling — inspect MCP tools and manage skill folders without an LLM session, plus repo-local install scope and Claude Code plugin packaging.

### Added

- `skillforge tools` CLI subcommand — prints the 5 MCP tools the server exposes (`skills__list`, `skills__get`, `skills__invoke`, `skills__configure`, `skills__reload`) with each tool's description, parameters, and an example invocation. Pass `--json` for machine-readable output. Lets you confirm the tool surface without starting an LLM session.
- `skillforge folders` CLI subcommand — manage skill folders from the terminal: `folders list [--json]`, `folders add <path> [--priority N] [--tags a,b] [--disabled]`, `folders remove <path>`, `folders reset --yes`. Previously folder management was only reachable via the `skills__configure` MCP tool inside an LLM session; both surfaces now read and write the same persisted config.
- `--scope global|project` flag on `skillforge install` / `skillforge uninstall`. The default `global` scope edits each host's home-directory config (unchanged behavior). `--scope project` wires SkillForge into a repo-local config rooted at the current directory — `.mcp.json` (Claude Code), `.codex/config.toml` (Codex CLI), `.cursor/mcp.json` (Cursor).
- Skill-source conflict detection. Registering a folder that already lives inside another tool's native skill store (a Claude Code plugin cache or a Gemini CLI extension) now surfaces a hint to disable the duplicate source — otherwise the same skills load twice and skill names collide. The `folders add` CLI prints the hint; the `skills__configure` `add_folder` action returns it as a `conflictHint` field. The conflict is informational only — it never blocks the folder from being added, and SkillForge never edits another tool's config.
- Claude Code plugin packaging — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. SkillForge can now be installed via `claude plugin install` (rich `/plugins` UI card) in addition to `claude mcp add` and `skillforge install`.

### Verified

- 535 / 535 tests passing + 1 win32-skip.
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean.
- `pnpm build` clean.
- `pnpm check:size` — all source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-15

Single-bin dispatcher — fixes `npx @lyupro/skillforge-mcp install --all` hanging on stdin.

### Fixed

- `npx @lyupro/skillforge-mcp install ...` previously hung because the package shipped two bins (`skillforge-mcp` → server, `skillforge` → install CLI), and `npx` matched the package's unscoped basename to the server bin, which silently waited on stdio. Both bins now resolve to a unified dispatcher that routes by the first positional argument.

### Added

- `src/cli/dispatcher.ts` — single CLI entry point that routes between `serve`, `install`, `uninstall`, `--help`, and `--version`.
- `skillforge-mcp serve` subcommand — explicit invocation of the MCP stdio server (default when no command is supplied).
- `skillforge-mcp --version` — prints the package version.
- Dispatcher unit tests covering help, version, serve routing, install/uninstall delegation, and unknown-command rejection.

### Changed

- `package.json#bin` — both `skillforge-mcp` and `skillforge` now point at `dist/cli/dispatcher.js`.
- `manifest.json#runtime.entry` — `dist/cli/dispatcher.js`. MCP host configs that auto-detect the entry pick up the dispatcher and fall through to `serve` when invoked with no args.
- Installer-generated host config entries now write `args: ['-y', '@lyupro/skillforge-mcp', 'serve']` explicitly. Older `['-y', '@lyupro/skillforge-mcp']` entries still work — the default subcommand resolves to `serve`.

### Verified

- All existing tests passing + dispatcher suite added.
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean.
- `pnpm build` clean.
- Manual smoke test from a fresh shell: `npx --yes @lyupro/skillforge-mcp@1.1.1 install --all --dry-run` outputs planned edits and exits cleanly.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-14

One-command install across Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Cursor.

### Added

- `skillforge install` CLI — wires SkillForge MCP into host tools by editing each host's config file directly.
- Three installers — Claude Code (`~/.claude.json`), Codex CLI (`~/.codex/config.toml`), Cursor (OS-specific `settings.json`).
- Flags — `--claude`, `--codex`, `--cursor`, `--all`, `--dry-run`, `--uninstall`, `--force`, `--entry npx|local`, `--binary-path <path>`.
- Atomic-write helper with `.backup` snapshot — failed write never leaves the host config in a broken state.
- OS-specific path detection for Cursor (Windows `%APPDATA%`, macOS `Library/Application Support`, Linux `~/.config`).
- Second package bin — `skillforge` → `./dist/cli/install.js` alongside the existing `skillforge-mcp` stdio server entry.
- New documentation — [docs/INSTALL_CLI.md](./docs/INSTALL_CLI.md) (flag table, examples, host edit shapes, troubleshooting).

### Verified

- 451 / 451 tests passing + 1 win32-skip (+81 new tests for the install CLI).
- `pnpm lint` (`tsc --noEmit`) clean.
- `pnpm build` clean.
- `pnpm check:size` — all 54 source files ≤ 400 lines.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-13

First public release. Universal Skills MCP server: load Markdown skills from arbitrary folders, lazy-by-design, cross-tool (Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor / custom MCP clients).

### Added — MCP tool surface (5 tools)

- `skills__list` — enumerate available skills with metadata-only response (filters: `folder`, `search`, `source`).
- `skills__get` — retrieve full content (body + metadata) of a named skill.
- `skills__invoke` — invoke a skill by name, forwarding optional input. Composite skills walk nested skills sequentially with DFS cycle detection. Pipeline: Logging → Timeout → Cache → strategy (Prompt / Script / Hybrid).
- `skills__configure` — manage configured folders, blacklist, reset (actions: `add_folder`, `remove_folder`, `list_folders`, `set_blacklist`, `get_blacklist`, `reset`). Persists to platform config path.
- `skills__reload` — force a full rescan of all configured folders. Returns `{ loaded, added, removed, errors }` diff.

### Added — Strategies

- **PromptStrategy** — default for skills without `scripts` metadata. Returns Markdown body as MCP text content.
- **ScriptStrategy** — sibling `scripts/` directory + manifest `scripts: [...]` entry. Opt-in via both `config.security.allowScripts = true` and frontmatter `allowScripts: true`. Sandboxed: env whitelist, mkdtemp cwd, AbortSignal kill.
- **HybridStrategy** — script produces context block prepended to the prompt body. Useful for `git log --since=last-tag` style enrichment.
- **CompositeResolver** — `skills: [a, b, c]` frontmatter walks nested skills sequentially. DFS cycle detection. Combined output returned.

### Added — Decorators

- **LoggingDecorator** — stderr trace of invocation lifecycle. Includes strategy name + ms duration.
- **TimeoutDecorator** — wraps `InvocationContext.signal` to enforce per-invocation timeout. Default 30s, override via `metadata.timeoutMs`.
- **CacheDecorator** — opt-in via `metadata.cacheable = true`. Returns identical `InvocationResult` instance (frozen `durationMs`) for repeat invocations within TTL.

### Added — Universal skill format

- Markdown body + YAML frontmatter contract.
- Canonical camelCase frontmatter + 4 snake_case aliases (`allow_scripts` / `allow_network` / `timeout_ms` / `cache_ttl_ms`).
- Four format dialects auto-detected: Claude (Anthropic), Codex (TOML-flavored), persona (character-style), custom (anything with frontmatter).
- Strategy decision tree: explicit `kind` field → metadata signals → default Prompt.

### Added — Configuration

- Persistent JSON config at the canonical Lyu Pro brand path `~/.lyupro/.skillforge/config.json`, resolved cross-platform via `os.homedir()`. Skills shared content lives under `~/.lyupro/skills/`.
- Folder cascade with priority — higher priority wins on name conflicts.
- Blacklist (manual + automatic via `PatternScanner` security audit).
- Hot reload via `chokidar` `FolderWatcher` — debounced batches, content-cache invalidation.
- Five worked configs in `examples/configs/`: `default.json`, `team-shared-folder.json`, `team-priority-with-default-fallback.json`, `scripts-enabled.json`, `multifolder-cascade.json`.

### Added — Security

- `PatternScanner` audit primitive — regex-based detection of dangerous patterns (`subprocess`, `os.system`, `pickle`, `__import__`, etc.).
- `BlacklistFilter` — manual entries + auto-flagged via audit. Loader gates skills before registry insertion.
- `SandboxRunner` for ScriptStrategy — env whitelist (`/usr/bin:/bin` POSIX), `mkdtemp` cwd, stdout/stderr cap (1 MB), AbortSignal kill on timeout, exit-code propagation.
- `Composite cycle detection` — DFS visited-set throws `CompositeCycleError` on loops.

### Added — Documentation

- `README.md` v1.0 — Pain/solution matrix, 60-second Quick Start, badges, status banner.
- `docs/INSTALL.md` — 4 wiring tracks (Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor / manual MCP client), folder-config 3 ways, verify checklist, upgrade/uninstall, 8-row troubleshooting matrix.
- `docs/SKILL_FORMAT.md` — field-level frontmatter contract, 4 dialects, strategy decision tree, 5 worked examples (prompt / script / hybrid / composite / persona), conflict resolution, validation rules.
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` — env vars + persisted JSON layers, annotated schema (live vs reserved fields), 5 `skills__configure` actions, `skills__reload` semantics, 4 worked configs.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — module map (11 directories), 9 design patterns with local references, full `skills__invoke` request flow trace, 3 cache surfaces, 5 extension points with snippets, rationale for anchor decisions.
- `docs/SECURITY.md` — threat model (8 in-scope + 5 out-of-scope rows), 5-step SandboxRunner contract, defence-in-depth layers, Windows PATH compromise documentation, operator checklist, responsible-disclosure policy.
- `docs/INTEGRATION/` — per-tool wiring: claude-code.md, codex.md, cursor.md, custom-llm-tools.md.

### Added — Sample skills

10 production-quality skills in `skills/`:

- **6 prompt** — `apple-hig-check`, `refactor-suggester`, `commit-message-writer`, `prompt-optimizer`, `idea-onepager`, `obsidian-resume`.
- **2 script** — `dependency-checker` (npm audit summariser, `scripts/main.sh`), `markdown-linter` (stdlib-only Python, `scripts/main.py`).
- **2 hybrid** — `changelog-generator` (git log since last semver tag), `git-blame-summary` (blame + recent commits enriched prompt).

All 10 verified through real parse pipeline + `StrategyFactory.create()` correct-kind assertion.

### Added — Marketplace artifacts

- `manifest.json` (upstream MCP schema) — 5 tools, env vars, doc pointers, verification commands.
- `plugin.json` (Claude Code marketplace schema) — install command, exposedTools, honest permissions block (subprocess opt-in, network none, filesystem write = platform config + tmpdir sandbox).

### Fixed — Real-frontmatter promotion (commit `a38e2c4`)

- `FrontmatterParser.CONSUMED_KEYS` now promotes `scripts`, `cacheable`, `cache_ttl_ms`, `cacheTtlMs` from real frontmatter. Earlier these fields fell into `extra` because `CONSUMED_KEYS` whitelist was opt-in; `ScriptStrategy.canHandle()` always returned false in the real subprocess pipeline.
- Defensive extraction: array-of-strings for `scripts`, boolean literal for `cacheable`, finite positive for `cacheTtlMs`.
- +6 unit tests (promotion, snake_case alias, defensive drops, extra-isolation).
- +2 integration tests verifying `script-promo` skill triggers `ScriptStrategy` and `cached-prompt` skill activates `CacheDecorator` (second invoke returns identical instance with frozen `durationMs`).
